# ComUnOhm
### Goal
This project is a free, open-source terminal focused on its ability to save and send char sequences easily to a device.

### Motivation
I'm needed to send the same commands too many times for hardware debugging. I prefer to spend days to automatize than copy-pasting.

### Features and future features
- [x] Save commands and reload these files
- [x] Ascii, HEX and UTF-8 encoding in RX (future : in TX too)
- [x] Open COM port automatically, select bitrate, COM port refresh
- [X] Dark mode
- [X] Close COM port automatically and manually
- [X] Free typing and transmitting if the log display is selected
- [ ] Restore previous configuration
- [ ] Hex detection and special char detection in command
- [ ] Translation 
- [ ] No bug (just kidding)
