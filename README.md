# ComUnOhm
### Goal
This project is a free, open-source terminal focused on it's ability to save and send char sequences easily to a device.

### Motivation
I'm needed to send the same commands to many time for hardware debugging. I prefer to spend days to automatize than copy-pasting.

### Features and futur feature
- [x] Save commands and reload theses files
- [x] Ascii, HEX and UTF-8 encoding in RX (futur : in TX too)
- [x] Open COM port automatically, select baudrate, COM port refresh
- [X] Dark mode
- [ ] Close COM port automatically and manually
- [ ] Restore previous configuration
- [ ] No bug (just kidding)
